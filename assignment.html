              My name is Sumit Singh and I am from Rudrapur, Uttarakhand. I am
              currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science
              and Engineering. Recently, I have been working on various projects
              such as a Book Recommender System, where I used Python and machine
              learning algorithms to implement collaborative filtering. Through
              this project, I explored several machine learning techniques and
              discovered a new framework, Streamlit, as well as Render.com, a
              platform that offers free hosting with simple GitHub integration.
              In addition to this, I have developed an SMS Spam Classifier using
              Python and a Gesture-Controlled System for gaming. In this
              project, I utilized computer vision and Python to create a system
              that controls gameplay through hand gestures. This project was
              particularly exciting for me as it deepened my understanding of
              computer vision and how it can be applied in interactive
              environments like gaming. My career objective is to become an
              innovative software engineer who delivers intelligent solutions
              that benefit society. I enjoy exploring new technologies and
              discovering creative ways to perform tech-based tasks during my
              leisure time. I am always eager and passionate about learning more
              in the world of technology.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              5 ring theory introduction is a concept in which person introduces
              himself step wise. steps are as follows: 
              <ol style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Place</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Family</li>
                <li>Goal</li>
              </ol>
              Including these elements in your introduction creates a lasting impact on the listener and provides a brief yet meaningful insight about you to the interviewer.

            <p class="video-title">Week 5 : Group discussion</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Group Discussion (GD) is a structured form of discussion where a group of candidates is given a topic or situation and asked to share their views within a specific time. It helps assess participants' communication skills, teamwork, leadership qualities, critical thinking, and ability to handle pressure. GDs are commonly used in job interviews, college admissions, and competitive exams to evaluate how well individuals articulate ideas, listen to others, and contribute meaningfully to a team discussion.
              In this week’s lab session, we had an insightful group discussion with our classmates under the guidance of Sir Vishal Chabbra on the topic, "Amendments in the Judiciary for Women's Safety." Along with practicing GD skills, we also had the opportunity to reflect deeply on women’s safety in our country from a broader perspective. It was truly an engaging and meaningful topic for discussion. </p>
